	abstract = {The present article addresses the following question: what variables condition syntactic transfer? Evidence is provided in support of the position that third language (L3) transfer is selective, whereby, at least under certain conditions, it is driven by the typological proximity of the target L3 measured against the other previously acquired linguistic systems (cf. Rothman and Cabrelli Amaro, 2007, 2010; Rothman, 2010; Montrul et al., 2011). To show this, we compare data in the domain of adjectival interpretation between successful first language (L1) Italian learners of English as a second language (L2) at the low to intermediate proficiency level of L3 Spanish, and successful L1 English learners of L2 Spanish at the same levels for L3 Brazilian Portuguese. The data show that, irrespective of the L1 or the L2, these L3 learners demonstrate target knowledge of subtle adjectival semantic nuances obtained via noun-raising, which English lacks and the other languages share. We maintain that such knowledge is transferred to the L3 from Italian (L1) and Spanish (L2) respectively in light of important differences between the L3 learners herein compared to what is known of the L2 Spanish performance of L1 English speakers at the same level of proficiency (see, for example, Judy et al., 2008; Rothman et al., 2010). While the present data are consistent with Flynn et al.’s (2004) Cumulative Enhancement Model, we discuss why a coupling of these data with evidence from other recent L3 studies suggests necessary modifications to this model, offering in its stead the Typological Primacy Model ({TPM}) for multilingual transfer.},

The {TPM} maintains that structural proximity between the L3 and the L1 and/or the L2 determines L3 transfer. In addition to demonstrating empirical support for the {TPM}, this article articulates a proposal for how the mind unconsciously determines typological (structural) proximity based on linguistic cues from the L3 input stream used by the parser early on to determine holistic transfer of one previous (the L1 or the L2) system. This articulated version of the {TPM} is motivated by argumentation appealing to cognitive and linguistic factors. Finally, in line with the general tenets of the {TPM}, I ponder if and why L3 transfer might obtain differently depending on the type of bilingual (e.g. early vs. late) and proficiency level of bilingualism involved in the L3 process.},

Although there is considerable evidence for L2 influence on vocabulary acquisition in L3, not all researchers believe that such influence generalizes to morphosyntactic aspects of the grammar. For example, Håkansson et al. (2002) introduce the Developmentally Moderated Transfer Hypothesis ({DMTH}), which incorporates transfer in Processability Theory ({PT}). They argue against syntactic transfer from L2 to L3. The present study presents counter-evidence to this hypothesis from two groups of learners with different L1s and L2s acquiring Swedish or Dutch as L3. The evidence clearly indicates that syntactic structures are more easily transferred from L2 than from L1 in the initial state of L3 acquisition. The two groups behave significantly differently as to the placement of negation, a difference that can be attributed to the L2 knowledge of the learners in interaction with the typological relationship between the L2 and the L3.},

	abstract = {Several studies on L3 lexicon, and recently also some on L3 syntax, have convincingly shown a qualitative difference between the acquisition of a true L2 and the subsequent acquisition of an L3. Some studies even indicate that L2 takes on a stronger role than L1 in the initial state of L3 syntax (e.g. Bardel and Falk, 2007; Rothman and Cabrelli Amaro, 2010). In this article we further investigate syntactic transfer from L1/L2 to L3 in learners at an intermediate level of proficiency in the target language. Data have been obtained from 44 learners of German as L3, testing the placement of object pronouns in both main and subordinate clauses in a grammaticality judgement/correction task ({GJCT}). The learners constitute two groups (both n = 22): One group has English as L1 and French as L2 and the other group has French as L1 and English as L2. This particular combination of background languages allows us to pinpoint the source of transfer, since object placement is pre-verbal in French and post-verbal in English, this being applied in both main and subordinate clauses. In target language ({TL}) German, however, the object placement varies between pre-verbal in the sub clause and post-verbal in the main clause. The two groups behave differently as to both acceptance and rejection of the test items (60 grammatical and ungrammatical main and sub clauses with object pronouns). This difference is significant and can be ascribed to their L2s, respectively. Our results thus show that the L2 transfers into the L3 even at an intermediate level, and on the basis of this we claim a strong role for the L2 status factor.},

	abstract = {Aims and Objectives:
              The main goal of the present study is to investigate effects of crosslinguistic influence in third language acquisition by simultaneous bilinguals. We address the following research questions: Do both languages contribute to crosslinguistic influence in third language acquisition, or is one of them chosen as the sole source of influence? Is crosslinguistic influence always from the typologically more similar language? Is crosslinguistic influence always facilitative, or can it also be non-facilitative?
            
            
              Methodology:
              The paper reports on a grammaticality judgment task with two word order conditions, both related to verb movement (verb-second in Norwegian and subject-auxiliary inversion in English).
            
            
              Data and Analysis:
              An experiment was carried out with three groups of 11-14-year-old participants, Norwegian-Russian bilinguals ( n=22), Norwegian-speaking monolinguals ( n=46), and Russian-speaking monolinguals ( n=31). The data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed effects logistic regression allowing us to estimate the effects of condition ( Adv-V, Aux-S), language (Norwegian, Norwegian-Russian, Russian) and their interaction on the correctness of judgments.
            
            
              Findings:
              The analysis reveals that while L1 Norwegian children over-accept ungrammatical sentences in English with a word order that reflects verb movement (V2), bilingual Norwegian-Russian children notice these errors significantly more often, just like L1 Russians. At the same time, the bilinguals score lower than L1 Russian children on grammatical trials, suggesting the presence of non-facilitative influence from Norwegian.
            
            
              Originality:
              This study argues for the Linguistic Proximity Model, which proposes incremental property-by-property learning and allows for both facilitative and non-facilitative influence from one or both of the previously acquired languages.
            
            
              Significance:
              The Linguistic Proximity Model and supporting experimental data contribute to existing models in third language acquisition by indicating that not just typological proximity but also structural similarity at an abstract level should be considered an important factor in third language acquisition.},

	abstract = {Aims and Objectives:
              This article proposes the “scalpel model,” a new model of third and additional language (L3/Ln) acquisition. The model aims to identify and examine what happens beyond the initial state of acquisition and what factors may influence change from one state of knowledge to another.
            
            
              Methodology:
              The article briefly examines the currently proposed hypotheses and models and evaluates the existing evidence for their predictions. It highlights several cognitive and experiential factors affecting crosslinguistic influence that are not taken into account by the current models. These factors include: structural linguistic complexity; misleading input or lack of clear unambiguous evidence for some properties or constructions; construction frequency in the target L3; and prevalent language activation or use.
            
            
              Data and analysis:
              Findings of recently published research are discussed in support of the scalpel model. In particular, findings of differential learnability of properties within the same groups of learners suggest that L1 or L2 transfer happens property by property and is influenced by diverse factors.
            
            
              Findings:
              The scalpel model explicitly argues that wholesale transfer of one of the previously acquired languages does not happen at the initial stages of acquisition because it is not necessary. It also argues that transfer can be from the L1 or the L2 or both, but it is not only facilitative.
            
            
              Originality:
              The new model increases the explanatory coverage of the current experimental findings on how the L3/Ln linguistic representations develop.
            
            
              Implications:
              The model emphasizes the importance of the cognitive, experiential, and linguistic influences on the L3/Ln beyond transfer from the L1 or L2. Thus, it aligns L3/Ln acquisition with current debates within L2 acquisition theory.},

We illustrate the {FT}/{FA} model by reviewing our analysis of the developmental Turkish-German Interlanguage data of Schwartz and Sprouse (1994) and then turn to other data that similarly receive straightforward accounts under {FT}/{FA}.
            We also consider two other competing hypotheses, both of which accept Full Access but not Full Transfer: the Minimal Trees hypothesis (no transfer of functional categories) of Vainikka and Young-Scholten (1994; 1996) and the Weak Transfer hypothesis (no transfer of the values associated with functional categories) of Eubank (1993/94). We provide an example of (extremely robust) L2 acquisition data that highlight the inadequacy of the Minimal Trees hypothesis in regard to stages of Interlanguage subsequent to the L2 initial state. As for Weak Transfer, we show that the morphosyntactic empirical foundations which drive the entire approach are flawed; hence the Weak Transfer hypothesis remains without motivation.
            Finally, we consider several conceptual issues relating to transfer. These all argue that the {FT}/{FA} model provides the most coherent picture of the L2 initial cognitive state. In short, {FT}/{FA} embodies the most suitable programme for understanding comparative Interlanguage development.},

We provide data from successful English-speaking learners of L2 Spanish at the initial state of acquiring L3 French and L3 Italian relating to properties of the Null-Subject Parameter (e.g. Chomsky, 1981; Rizzi, 1982). We compare these groups to each other, as well as to groups of English learners of L2 French and L2 Italian at the initial state, and conclude that the data are consistent with the predictions of the ‘L2 status factor’. However, we discuss an alternative possible interpretation based on (psycho)typologically-motivated transfer (borrowing from Kellerman, 1983), providing a methodology for future research in this domain to meaningfully tease apart the ‘L2 status factor’ from this alternative account.},

Previous research has shown that both L1 and L2 are used in L3 oral production, and different explanatory factors have been put forward, e.g. (psycho)typology and L2 status. However, these factors do not explain why function words tend to come from L2 while content words seem to be transferred from both L1 and L2 to a larger extent. In order to explain transfer patterns in L3, we use the declarative/procedural model (Paradis 2009), and hypothesize that syntactic transfer will come from L2; transfer of function words from L2; and transfer of content words from both L1 and L2. We analyze lexical and syntactic transfer in eleven native German speakers’ retellings of an episode from a mute video film. The results largely seem to support Paradis’ model.},

The main goal is to determine which of the models is best able to predict and explain syntactic transfer in three experimental groups: mirror-image groups of first/second language (L1/L2) English/Spanish bilinguals (i) L1 English/L2 Spanish and (ii) L1 Spanish/L2 English, and (iii) heritage Spanish/English bilinguals. The data provide evidence to support the Typological Primacy Model (Rothman, 2010, 2011, 2013), which predicts Spanish transfer irrespective of its status as an L1, L2 or bilingual first language (2L1). Additionally, the heritage speaker and L1 English group results, taken together, provide evidence for Iverson's (2009) claim that comparing such populations adds independent supportive evidence that the acquisition of linguistic features or properties in an L2 acquired past puberty is not subject to a maturational critical period.},

We compare the oral production of 40 participants with varying degrees of explicit {MLK} of the L1, who are exposed to a completely new L3. In accordance with the second language (L2) status factor, which is further motivated by the distinction between implicit competence and explicit knowledge (Bardel \& Falk, 2012; Paradis, 2009), we hypothesize that the participants with low explicit {MLK} in their L1 will transfer from their L2, and that the participants with high explicit {MLK} in the L1 will transfer from their L1. The structure of interest is adjective placement, which is the same in the L1 and the L3 (but not in the participants’ L2s). The results show that the degree of explicit {MLK} in the L1 plays a decisive role at the initial state of L3 learning.},

Yet, there are also claims of either a more noticeable effect of the L2 on the L3, or a prevailing influence from the L1. This study further explores whether the L1 and the L2 compete or converge on exerting influence on L3 pronunciation. To do so, we examine the production of voice onset time for voiceless stops by adult advanced learners of L3 Spanish divided into two groups (15 L1 English-L2 French, and 15 L1 French-L2 English speakers). Three monolingual control groups were also tested. Participants were recorded reading word lists that contained voiceless stops in stressed onset position. A Kruskal-Wallis test uncovered significant differences traceable to the L1-English speakers, which puts them at a slight disadvantage vis-à-vis their Francophone counterparts. These results favor claims of a more decisive role for the L1 in L3 pronunciation. We compare our results to findings from previous studies targeting intermediate learners, and find proficiency in the L3 may account for the observed differences.},

            Previous studies attest that early bilinguals can modify their perceptual identification according to the fine-grained phonetic detail of the language they believe they are hearing. Following Gonzales et al. (2019), we replicate the double phonemic boundary effect in late learners ({LBs}) using conceptual-based cueing. We administered a forced choice identification task to 169 native English adult learners of Spanish in two sessions. In both sessions, participants identified the same /b/-/p/ voicing continuum, but language context was cued conceptually using the instructions. The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel regression. Learners categorized the continuum in a similar manner when they believed they were hearing English. However, when they believed they were hearing Spanish, “voiceless” responses increased as a function of L2 proficiency. This research demonstrates the double phonemic boundary effect can be conceptually cued in {LBs} and supports accounts positing selective activation of independent perception grammars in L2 learning.},

            The language history questionnaire ({LHQ}) is an important tool for assessing the linguistic background and language proficiency of multilinguals or second language learners. Previously we developed a generic {LHQ} based on the most commonly asked questions in published studies (Li, Sepanski \& Zhao, 2006) and provided a web-based interface ({LHQ} 2.0) that has flexibility in functionality, accuracy in data recording, and privacy for users and data (Li, Zhang, Tsai \& Puls, 2014). {LHQ}3 (version 3) introduces new functions, developed in response to many comments/requests from users. One important improvement is the addition of an automatic scoring system, in that the new interface automatically calculates aggregated scores for language proficiency, language dominance, and language immersion levels. Finally, {LHQ}3 allows researchers to assign different weights to the modules when calculating the aggregated scores, addressing the issue of different focuses that different researchers put on multilingual speakers’ language usage and background.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the interpretation of {NPs} in generic and existential contexts in the acquisition of Brazilian Portuguese ({BrP}) as a third language (L3) by learners who speak English and a Romance language (Spanish, French or Italian). The paper examines whether transfer / cross-linguistic influence is from English, Spanish/French/Italian, or both, and whether it matters which language is the learners’ first language (L1) vs. their second language (L2). An Acceptability Judgment Task of {NP} interpretation in {BrP} is administered to L1-English L2-Spanish/French/Italian and L1-Spanish L2-English learners of {BrP} as an L3, as well as to a control group of native speakers of {BrP}. The findings point to a nuanced picture of transfer in L3 acquisition, in which both languages can serve as the source of transfer, but transfer from a previously learned Romance language is more pronounced than transfer from English, both for L1-English L2-Romance and L1-Spanish L2-English L3-learners of {BrP}.},

The /pεn/-/bεn/ minimal pair, meaningful in both languages, was used as a base for identification tests, which were presented with either an English or a French precursor word before each token. Two stimulus continua, formed of digitally-edited natural speech tokens, had an identical {VOT} range but varied in their [εn] stem. In their production of the contrast, bilinguals showed clear evidence of code-switching but did not always produce monolingual-like {VOTs} in their weaker language. In perception, the code-switching effect was significant but small. The bilingual group with English as primary early language showed a greater effect of vowel onset characteristics, in conflictingcue conditions, than the bilingual group with French as their primary early language, and, on average, cue-weighting was not affected by the language of the precursor. An effect of language dominance on cue-weighting was therefore found.},

	abstract = {Aims and objectives/purpose/research questions:
              This study aims to improve our understanding of common switching patterns by examining determiner–noun–adjective complexes in code-switching ({CS}) in three language pairs (Welsh–English, Spanish–English and Papiamento–Dutch). The languages differ in gender and noun–adjective word order in the noun phrase ({NP}): (a) Spanish, Welsh, and Dutch have gender; English and Papiamento do not; (b) Spanish, Welsh, and Papiamento prefer post-nominal adjectives; Dutch and English, prenominal ones. We test predictions on determiner language and adjective order derived from generativist accounts and the Matrix Language Frame ({MLF}) approach.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach:
              We draw on three publicly available spoken corpora. For the purposes of these analyses, we re-coded all three datasets identically. From the three re-coded corpora we extracted all monolingual and mixed simplex {NPs} ({DetN}) and complex {NPs} with determiners (determiner–adjective–noun ({DetAN}/{NA})). We then examined the surrounding clause for each to determine the matrix language based on the finite verb.
            
            
              Data and analysis:
              We analysed the data using a linear regression model in R statistical software to examine the distribution of languages across word class and word order in the corpora.
            
            
              Findings/conclusions:
              Overall, the generativist predictions are borne out regarding adjective positions but not determiners and the {MLF} accounts for more of the data. We explore extra-linguistic explanations for the patterns observed.
            
            
              Originality:
              The current study has provided new empirical data on nominal {CS} from language pairs not previously considered.
            
            
              Significance/implications:
              This study has revealed robust patterns across three corpora and taken a step towards disentangling two theoretical accounts. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of comparing multiple language pairs using similar coding.},

            The language history questionnaire ({LHQ}) is an important tool for assessing the linguistic background and language proficiency of multilinguals or second language learners. Previously we developed a generic {LHQ} based on the most commonly asked questions in published studies (Li, Sepanski \& Zhao, 2006) and provided a web-based interface ({LHQ} 2.0) that has flexibility in functionality, accuracy in data recording, and privacy for users and data (Li, Zhang, Tsai \& Puls, 2014). {LHQ}3 (version 3) introduces new functions, developed in response to many comments/requests from users. One important improvement is the addition of an automatic scoring system, in that the new interface automatically calculates aggregated scores for language proficiency, language dominance, and language immersion levels. Finally, {LHQ}3 allows researchers to assign different weights to the modules when calculating the aggregated scores, addressing the issue of different focuses that different researchers put on multilingual speakers’ language usage and background.},

	isbn = {978-1-303-65119-9},
	shorttitle = {A Study of the Relationship between Code Switching and the Bilingual Advantage},
	abstract = {Bilinguals sometimes outperform age-matched monolinguals on non-language tasks involving cognitive control. But the bilingual advantage is not consistently found in every experiment and may reflect specific attributes of the bilinguals tested. The goal of this dissertation was to determine if the way in which bilinguals use language, specifically switching between languages within a conversation (code switching) or refraining from this behavior, plays a role in the sporadic bilingual advantage. The bilingual advantage may arise from managing interference from one language in order to stay in the other, or from inhibiting one language in order to switch into the other. If language switching engages a general inhibitory mechanism to stop speaking in one language and switch to the other, bilinguals who frequently code switch ("switchers") might outperform bilingual "non-switchers" on non-language inhibition tasks. Alternatively, if the bilingual advantage results from frequent inhibition of interference from one language to stay in the other, non-switchers might outperform switchers. The Assessment of Code-Switching Experience Survey ({ACSES}) was created to obtain an objective, rapid, and reliable measure for Spanish-English bilinguals' code-switching frequency. Then, event-related potentials ({ERPs}) of bilinguals with varied code-switching frequency were measured during a language task, lending validity to the survey. Semantic violations in code-switched and non-switched words were embedded in sentences as probes to determine how code-switches are processed and whether processing of code-switches is modulated by code-switching experience. The amplitude of a code switching positivity (typically elicited to a code-switch), but not the amplitude of the N400 (typically elicited to a semantic anomaly), was modulated by code-switching frequency. This indicates that code-switching experience affects processing of a code-switch but not semantic retrieval. During Simon and Flanker inhibition tasks, which require suppression of interference from incongruent stimulus cues, a larger N2 {ERP} was elicited for incongruent versus congruent trials. The amplitude of this N2 congruity effect is typically correlated with inhibitory control ability. The effect was carried by the non-switchers; switchers and monolinguals did not differ. Thus, a general bilingual advantage was not found. Rather, non-switchers manifested a larger neural response linked to inhibitory control of interference, which may result from inhibiting interference in one language in order to stay in the other. However, no difference between switchers, non-switchers, and monolinguals was found on inhibition tasks that required simple response inhibition in the absence of interference. Thus, language production may differentially tap into existing cognitive control mechanisms that are specific to the way in which we are using language. I have interpreted the non-switcher interference suppression advantage in terms of recent studies demonstrating switching benefits in switchers and spatial benefits in bilinguals who use sign language. I suggest refining the definition of the bilingual advantage to include multiple aspects of cognition that are differentially affected by language experience.

	abstract = {This chapter provides a selective overview of recent research on the phonetics and phonology of bilingualism. The central idea put forth in the chapter is that, in bilingualism and second-language learning, cross-language categories are involved in complex interactions that can take many forms, including assimilations and dissimilations. The sound categories of the two languages of a bilingual seem to coexist in a common representational network and appear to be activated simultaneously in the processing of speech in real time, but some degree of specificity is attested. The chapter then goes on to explore some of the characteristics of cross-language sound interactions, including the fact that these interactions are pliable and appear to be mediated by the structure of the lexicon.},

	abstract = {Psychologists must be able to test both for the presence of an effect and for the absence of an effect. In addition to testing against zero, researchers can use the two one-sided tests ({TOST}) procedure to test for equivalence and reject the presence of a smallest effect size of interest ({SESOI}). The {TOST} procedure can be used to determine if an observed effect is surprisingly small, given that a true effect at least as extreme as the {SESOI} exists. We explain a range of approaches to determine the {SESOI} in psychological science and provide detailed examples of how equivalence tests should be performed and reported. Equivalence tests are an important extension of the statistical tools psychologists currently use and enable researchers to falsify predictions about the presence, and declare the absence, of meaningful effects.},
